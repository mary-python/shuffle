# Extending the Shuffle Model of Differential Privacy to Vectors: Experimental Evaluation

This repository contains all the supporting files for the experimental section of the paper _Extending the Shuffle Model of Differential Privacy to Vectors_,
including all the Python files necessary for anyone to repeat all of the experiments given as evidence for the results in the paper.
Note that the files **mitbih_test.csv** and **mitbih_train.csv** from the [**ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat) must be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the Python files.
